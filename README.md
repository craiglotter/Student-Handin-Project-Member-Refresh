Student-Handin-Project-Member-Refresh
=====================================

Student Handin Project Creator generated student hand in folders for given course assignments, automatically giving each student full rights to their respective folders. The problem is that students are always registering or deregistering from the course at any given time, meaning that the possibility of a student's personal handin folder not existing is very real.
